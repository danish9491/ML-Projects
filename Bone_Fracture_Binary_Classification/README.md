## Project Overview
This project is a binary classification model designed to detect bone fractures in X-ray images using deep learning. By leveraging transfer learning on a pre-trained ResNet18 model, the model achieves a robust performance on this task, making it suitable for assisting radiologists in identifying fractures.

## Dataset
- **Classes**: Fractured, Not Fractured
- **Directory Structure**:
  - `train`: Training set images.
  - `val`: Validation set images.
  - `test`: Test set images.


## Model Architecture
The model is based on **ResNet18**, pre-trained on ImageNet, and fine-tuned for binary classification:
- **Frozen Layers**: All layers except the final fully connected layers.
- **Modified Output Layer**: Adjusted to a binary classification with sigmoid activation.

## Data Preprocessing
Data augmentation and normalization are applied to improve model generalization:
- **Training**: Resize to 224x224, Random Horizontal Flip, Random Rotation (10Â°), Random Resized Crop, Normalize.
- **Validation/Test**: Resize to 224x224, Normalize.

## Training and Early Stopping
Training uses **Binary Cross Entropy Loss** and **Adam Optimizer** with a learning rate scheduler:
- **Early Stopping**: Prevents overfitting by monitoring validation loss and stopping training if no improvement is seen after several epochs.

## Evaluation and Results

### Key Performance Metrics:
- **Accuracy**: 86.76% on the test set
