# ML Projects Repository

Welcome to my collection of Machine Learning projects! In this repository, I will upload all my upcoming ML-related projects, which cover a variety of algorithms, techniques, and real-world applications. Each project will be documented with instructions, code, and resources to help you understand how these models and algorithms work.

## Projects Included

### 1. **[Bone Fracture Classification using Transfer Learning (ResNet18)](https://github.com/danish9491/ML-Projects/tree/main/bone-fracture-classification)**
   - **Description**: A binary classification model that detects bone fractures in X-ray images using **ResNet18** with transfer learning. 
   - **Key Features**: Utilizes **transfer learning**, **data augmentation**, **early stopping**, and **learning rate scheduling** to classify images into fractured or non-fractured categories.
   - **Technologies Used**: Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Matplotlib
   - **Results**: Achieved **89% accuracy** on the test set, with solid performance on both fractured and non-fractured categories.

### 2. **[Upcoming Project Name]**
   - **Description**: A brief overview of what the project aims to solve or demonstrate.
   - **Key Features**: Main highlights or insights from the project.
   - **Technologies Used**: Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.
   - **Results**: Briefly explain any outcomes or findings.

> _Each project will have a dedicated directory with more specific instructions, datasets, and requirements. Check the individual project README files for details._
